## Hi there 👋
I’m a .NET developer with over 15 years of experience, working in teams of 2 to 18 people, both remotely and on-site. I bring more than 4 years of team leadership experience and have built full-stack applications while managing the entire lifecycle: from gathering and structuring requirements to implementation, infrastructure, analytics, and CI/CD pipelines.

I care deeply about clarity in both code and processes and can get genuinely passionate about improving and simplifying things. I believe in leadership by example and see trust as the strongest possible foundation for a team. I’ve also always been strong in direct client communication and in building trust-based relationships, which I consider essential for a clear understanding of goals and an effective feedback process.

Outside of work, I’ve been playing guitar in a local band for over 10 years and have recorded and released more than 4 albums by now. I’m also a fan of kettlebell training. Regularly doing hard things, I believe, is a great way to stay humble.
